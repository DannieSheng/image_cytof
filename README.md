# Image_Cytof
A python-based software package targeted for analyzing Cytof images captured by the Hyperion™ 
imaging system. 

**Claim**: the full repo of the package is still protected and released. 
Only main ideas and visualization is presented here. 
Accessing the repo is upon request through email.

**IMC** (Imaging Mass Cytometry): 
- A powerful high-throughput technique enabling resolution of up to 37 markers in a fixed tissue section, 
with the spatial relationships preserved simultaneously.  
- This next-generation technology relies on the general principles of IHC (immunohistochemistry) 
but instead uses antibodies conjugated to rare earth metals with a discrete mass.
- Combines IHC (immunohistochemistry) staining using metal isotope-labelled antibodies with laser ablation 
and mass-spectrometry-based detection to produce high-dimensional images
- The resulting image is a multi-spectral image of a tissue, where each channel represents for a specific marker. 

ROI:  an area on the tissue sample that is determined prior to data acquisition and is imaged by the Hyperion™ system.
